# Whitmore-Lake-Varsity-Football-An-Exploration

## Prompt

This assignment requires that you to find datasets on the web which are related, and that you visualize these datasets to answer a question with the broad topic of **sports or athletics** (see below) for the region of **Whitmore Lake, Michigan, United States**, or **United States** more broadly.

Here are the assignment instructions:

 * State the region and the domain category that your data sets are about (e.g., **Whitmore Lake, Michigan, United States** and **sports or athletics**).
 * You must state a question about the domain category and region that you identified as being interesting.
 * You must provide links to available datasets. These could be links to files such as CSV or Excel files, or links to websites which might have data in tabular form, such as Wikipedia pages.
 * You must upload an image which addresses the research question you stated. In addition to addressing the question, this visual should follow Cairo's principles of truthfulness, functionality, beauty, and insightfulness.
 * You must contribute a short (1-2 paragraph) written justification of how your visualization addresses your stated research question.

What do we mean by **sports or athletics**?  For this category we are interested in sporting events or athletics broadly, please feel free to creatively interpret the category when building your research question!

## Data
Data is from: https://www.maxpreps.com/mi/whitmore-lake/whitmore-lake-trojans/football/roster/all-time/ 

## Discussion
Question of interest: What is the distribution of grade-levels in varsity level high school football? As explored through Whitmore Lake Trojans.

American varsity sports are a direct gateway to professional athletic careers. Since I did not attend high school in the United States, I was interested to understand a little bit more about the high-school varsity teams. The region I was assigned to explore was Whitmore Lake, Michigan. After much research, I found data on high school athletes who played varsity football. In order to understand the distribution of the kind of players participating in varsity football, I decided to zoom in on the grade-level variable (freshman, sophomore, juniors and seniors).

My visualization explores this research question by plotting a vertically stacked bar-plot with the height corresponding to the number of players in each year. It has color-coded bars into the four categories of the grade-levels. Further, it also displayes the % freshmen, sophomore etc. of the team playing in that year. Thus this visualization shows us the distribution of players in a simple and easy-to-read manner.  

We can see that usually the highest percentage of players are seniors, followed by juniors. This kind-of aligns with our expectations since players who are older, probably are more skilled and physically bigger, which matters a lot in football. There are some years when there are no freshmen on the team, but in 2018, freshmen formed 100% of the team. It is important to note, however, that 2018 and 2012 have very few data points, not enough to form a whole team, which either means that the team did not play that year and just continued practice, or that there is missing data/ players. There was no grade-level data for year 2010.

## Final Output
Final visualization can be found [here](https://github.com/ridhika123/Whitmore-Lake-Varsity-Football-An-Exploration/blob/main/WhitmoreLakeVarsityFootball.png).

## Further Improvement 
To scale the code, I would replace manual data entering with web-scraping.
